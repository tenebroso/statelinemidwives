								<span class="image main"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We began this journey to help assist the families of Illinois where the politics and policies greatly restrict choices. Our love and compassion for these families are what lead us to forming Stateline Midwives, and opening our Wisconsin birth center. We are always accepting new clients in both Wisconsin and Illinois.</p>

								<h3>Andrea Bukiewicz</h3>
								<p>Hey! I&rsquo;m Andrea Bukiewicz. I am a Certified Professional Midwife and a Licensed midwife in the state of Wisconsin. My midwifery journey began in 2007, assisting women in both hospital and home. Here I saw our cultures disillusion towards birth and the harm it can cause. This experience catapulted my midwifery studies, beginning with my midwifery degree from National College of Midwifery in Taos New Mexico. I have had the honor of participating in a few hundred births, the bulk of them in the homes of my clients. I believe in the power of women mentoring women. This belief not only held true during my 4 year traditional midwifery apprenticeship, but it also reflects in the care that I give.</p>
								<p>In 2013 my studies sent me to Bali Indonesia. Here I spent a summer interning at<a href="http://www.bumisehatfoundation.org/"> Bumi Sehat</a> Birth Center and apprenticed under awarded humanitarian, Ibu Robin Lim. This experience helped me mature into the midwife you will know today. A strong woman who is here to protect our rite of passage and help women birth in such a way that honors its process, all while providing evidence based care and informed consent.</p>
								<p>My own introduction to the healing arts and feminine teaching looked very similar to my midwifery apprenticeships, my grandmother sharing her eucalyptus folk remedies and family stories. Her love began the preparation for what was to come and helped cultivate my spirit and trade. Outside of midwifery and folk herbalism I am an athlete, writer, sex educator and coach, tattoo enthusiast, devout animist and avid traveler with my two children and our Goldendoodle, Loki.</p>

								<h3>Stephnie</h3>
								<p>Hello, I am so excited to be here introducing myself! I am Stephnie, Midwife Apprentice, AKA
									Andrea's extra set of hands.</p>
								<p>My journey into birth work began with the birth of my fourth and last child. When I became
									pregnant that time, I was working in child welfare as a social worker and had already been well
									on the path of moving toward a more holistic approach to well-being in that career as well as in
									my personal life. I began to explore the midwifery model of care. I chose to give birth to baby
									number four with a midwife, out of the hospital, in a free-standing birth center. What stood out to
									me most from this experience aside from the experience of the birth itself, was the prenatal care
									I received. It was individualized, thorough, and most of all empowering. I had never felt safer,
									more in control or cared for when having a baby even though I'd done it several times before. I
									left that experience with a passion to support other women in having that same type of
									compassionate and empowering care.</p>
								<p>My experience as a birth worker began in the years that followed the birth of my youngest. I
									began studying birth from a physiological perspective, and eventually became a birth doula
									where I was honored to support well over fifty women through their birth experiences.</p>
								<p>In the summer of 2021, I came on board with the stateline midwives as an apprentice. I am now
									working as Andrea's assistant where I hope to continue to grow, learn, and serve many families.</p>
								<p class="less-margin"><strong>Education includes:</strong></p>
